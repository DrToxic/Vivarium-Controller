# Vivarium Controller

Nothing to see here, Move along.

This is the very beginning of life for this application.
There are many ways I could have done this, but this is how I'm doing it.

Target machine: HP Thin Client, 1gb RAM, 2gb ROM (IDE Flash disk)
        Extras: Velleman K8055 Experimental USB Board

Target Operating System: MiniXP (It's 2018, XP support got dropped ages ago.. but it's just enough OS for this task. This may change if I come across a bigger IDE Flash Disk.

Chosen development language: BlitzBasic (BlitzPLUS 1.47)

Things to note: I'm not developing this directly on the target machine yet, so we're using a temporary window... there's a high chance we're going to drop the window entirely and just run as a full screen application. not sure yet.
